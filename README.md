# RISC-V-Processor
Designed and implemented a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor in RTL, adhering to the RV32I variant of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The processor was developed using Verilog HDL and features distinct pipeline stages—Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback—ensuring efficient data processing and instruction throughput. The design incorporates hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms to handle data and control dependencies, along with branch prediction logic to optimize performance. Additionally, the project includes comprehensive testing and verification frameworks with testbenches and simulation tools to validate functional correctness and timing performance. This implementation demonstrates expertise in RTL design, pipeline optimization, and RISC-V architecture principles.
